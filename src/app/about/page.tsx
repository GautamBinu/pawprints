            <p>
              Search for petitions and if a petition similar to yours already
              exists, sign that petition. This will help raise support for your
              issue and help you better reach the minimum threshold of 100
              signatures for receiving an official Student Government response.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Write your petition</h3>

            <p>
              Use proper spelling and grammar when writing your petition. This
              will help other users find the petition more easily. Be sure to
              review our Moderation Policy before posting.
            </p>

            <p>
              Use social media to spread awareness of your issue. A petition has
              one year to reach its threshold. If the threshold is not reached,
              then the petition is archived and available via the search.
